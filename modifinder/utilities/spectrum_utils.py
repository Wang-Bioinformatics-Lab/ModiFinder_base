    This function is used to refine a spectrum based on the consensus of the other spectrums
    any peak that is not in the consensus of the other spectrums is removed.

    Parameters
    ----------

        mz_tolerance: float
            The tolerance in mz
        consensus_majority_ratio: float (0-1) [default: 0]
            The ratio of the spectrums that should have the peak in order to keep it, 0 means none of the spectrums need to have it
